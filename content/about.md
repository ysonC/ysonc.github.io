## Projects

### Home Lab (Individual Project)

Jan. 2025 - Present

- Built a cluster on three Raspberry Pi 5 devices, leveraging K3s for lightweight Kubernetes orchestration.
- Employed Ansible to provision and configure the cluster and used Kustomize for environment-specific configurations.
- Implemented Flux for GitOps continuous delivery, ensuring seamless rollouts and version control across the entire setup.
- Deployed Longhorn for container-native distributed storage, integrated CloudNativePG for a robust PostgreSQL operator in Kubernetes, and configured Traefik as the Ingress Controller.
- Utilised Tailscale for secure remote access and set up a Prometheus & Grafana monitoring stack to capture real-time metrics and performance insights.
- Continually refining the environment to adopt new tools, improve automation pipelines, and enhance system resilience.

### Memory Safety Execution in C (Master Dissertation)

Mar. 2025 - Sep. 2025

- Conducted a master’s dissertation comparing Checked C, Fail-Safe C, and Rust in retrofitting memory safety to legacy C software.
- Developed and benchmarked Zlib 1.3.1 and micro-benchmarks to evaluate performance, safety coverage, and developer effort.
- Implemented automated build and profiling pipelines across legacy toolchains and modern compilers.
- Quantified spatial and temporal protection trade-offs through runtime analysis and code-conversion metrics.
- Produced a comprehensive evaluation informing practical paths toward safer systems programming in C ecosystems.

### Face Recognition with Raspberry Pi (Bachelor Dissertation)

Dec. 2023 - May. 2024

- Designed and implemented a low-cost home security system using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and TensorFlow on a Raspberry Pi, featuring real-time face recognition and motion detection.
- Trained a Siamese neural network in Google Colab to perform one-shot face recognition, optimised for single-user accuracy (~85%) and efficient on-device inference.
- Developed a secure, user-friendly web interface for access control and remote monitoring.
- Ensured ethical and privacy-conscious use by employing diverse training samples, bias-aware evaluation, and local, privacy-preserving data storage.
